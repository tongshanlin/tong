<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks together sequester &gt;50% of the
   anthropogenic emissions, and the major uncertainty in the global carbon
   budget is related to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Hence, it is
   important to understand the major drivers of the land carbon uptake to
   make informed decisions on climate change mitigation policies. In this
   paper, we assess the major drivers of the land carbon uptake-CO2
   fertilization, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and land use/land
   cover changes (LULCC)-from existing literature for the historical period
   and future scenarios, focusing on the results from fifth Coupled Models
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The existing literature shows that the
   LULCC fluxes have led to a decline in the terrestrial carbon stocks
   during the historical period, despite positive contributions from CO2
   fertilization and nitrogen deposition. However, several studies find
   increases in the land carbon sink in recent decades and suggest that CO2
   fertilization is the primary driver (up to 85%) of this increase
   followed by nitrogen deposition (similar to 10%-20%). For the 21st
   century, terrestrial carbon stocks are projected to increase in the
   majority of CMIP5 simulations under the representative concentration
   pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6), RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, mainly due to CO2
   fertilization. These projections indicate that the effects of nitrogen
   deposition in future scenarios are small (similar to 2%-10%), and
   climate warming would lead to a loss of land carbon. The vast majority
   of the studies consider the effects of only one or two of the drivers,
   impairing comprehensive assessments of the relative contributions of the
   drivers. Further, the broad range in magnitudes and scenario/model
   dependence of the sensitivity factors pose challenges in unambiguous
   projections of land carbon uptake. Improved representation of processes
   such as LULCC, fires, nutrient limitation and permafrost thawing in the
   models are necessary to constrain the present-day carbon cycle and for
   more accurate future projections.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Most empirical and modeling research on soil carbon (C) dynamics has
   focused on those processes that control and promote C stabilization.
   However, we lack a strong, generalizable understanding of the mechanisms
   through which soil organic carbon (SOC) is destabilized in soils. Yet a
   clear understanding of C destabilization processes in soil is needed to
   quantify the feedbacks of the soil C cycle to the Earth system.
   Destabilization includes processes that occur along a spectrum through
   which SOC shifts from a 'protected' state to an 'available' state to
   microbial cells where it can be mineralized to gaseous forms or to
   soluble forms that are then lost from the soil system. These processes
   fall into three general categories: (1) release from physical occlusion
   through processes such as tillage, bioturbation, or freeze-thaw and
   wetting-drying cycles; (2) C desorption from soil solids and colloids;
   and (3) increased C metabolism. Many processes that stabilize soil C can
   also destabilize C, and C gain or loss depends on the balance between
   competing reactions. For example, earthworms may both destabilize C
   through aggregate destruction, but may also create new aggregates and
   redistribute C into mineral horizon. Similarly, mycorrhizae and roots
   form new soil C but may also destabilize old soil C through priming and
   promoting microbial mining; labile C inputs cause C stabilization
   through increased carbon use efficiency or may fuel priming. Changes to
   the soil environment that affect the solubility of minerals or change
   the relative surfaces charges of minerals can destabilize SOC, including
   increased pH or in the reductive dissolution of Fe-bearing minerals. By
   considering these different physical, chemical, and biological controls
   as processes that contribute to soil C destabilization, we can develop
   thoughtful new hypotheses about the persistence and vulnerability of C
   in soils and make more accurate and robust predictions of soil C cycling
   in a changing environment.</td>
